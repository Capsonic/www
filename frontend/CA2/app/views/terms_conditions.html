                        <p>All Goods may be inspected and tested by Capsonic, its customers, higher-tier contractors, and end users at all reasonable times and places. If an inspection or a testing is made on Supplier’s premises, Supplier will provide, without additional charge, all reasonable facilities and assistance required for the inspection and tests. In its standard inspection and testing of the Goods, Supplier will use an inspection system accepted by Capsonic in writing. All inspection records, including sub tier supplier records relating to the Goods, will be maintained by Supplier and made available to Capsonic during the performance of this Purchase Order, and for such longer periods as may be specified by Capsonic.</p>
                        <p>
                            Final inspection and acceptance by Capsonic will be at destination unless otherwise specified in this Purchase Order. Capsonic may inspect 100% or a sample of Goods, at Capsonic’s option, and may reject all or any portion of the Goods or lot of Goods if Capsonic determines them to be defective or nonconforming. If Capsonic performs any inspection (other than the standard inspection) after discovering defective or nonconforming Goods, any additional inspection costs will be paid by Supplier. No inspection, tests, approval, design approval, or acceptance of the Goods relieves Supplier from responsibility for warranty or any latent defects, fraud, or negligence. If the Goods are defective or otherwise do not conform to the requirements of this Purchase Order, Capsonic may, by written notice to Supplier: (a) rescind this Purchase Order as to the Goods; (b) accept the Goods at an equitable reduction in price; or (c) reject the Goods and require the delivery of replacements. Delivery of replacements will be accompanied by a written notice specifying that such Goods are replacements. If Supplier fails to deliver required replacements promptly, Capsonic may correct any retained defective or nonconforming Goods at Supplier’s expense; replace them with Goods from another supplier and charge the Supplier the cost thereof, including cover, and any incidental costs; or terminate this Purchase Order for cause.</p>

                        <p>Supplier warrants to Capsonic, its successors, assigns, customers, and end users that, upon delivery, and during the entire Warranty Period specified below, all Goods furnished (including all replacement or corrected Goods or components that Supplier furnishes under this warranty) will (a) be free from defects in material, workmanship, and design, even if the design has been approved by Capsonic, (b) conform to applicable drawings, designs, quality control plans, specifications and samples and other descriptions furnished or specified by Capsonic, (c) be merchantable, (d) be fit for the intended purposes (to the extent the Goods are not of a detailed design furnished by Capsonic) and operate as intended, (e) comply with all applicable national and local laws, (f) be free and clear of any and all liens, restrictions, reservations, security interests, or encumbrances, and (g) not infringe any patent, published patent application, or other intellectual property rights of any third party existing as of the date of delivery, and not utilize misappropriated third party trade secret information. Services will be performed in accordance with the highest standards in the industry.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Warranty Period will be for a period of 24 months from the date of delivery to the end user or such longer period of time as may have been accepted by Capsonic from Capsonic’s customer or the date on which any longer or broader government requirement covering the Goods ends. These warranties will survive any delivery, inspection, acceptance, or payment by Capsonic for the entire Warranty Period. Claims for breach of warranty do not accrue until discovery of noncompliance, even if the Goods were previously inspected. The warranties provided are cumulative and in addition to any warranty provided by law or equity. Any applicable statute of limitations runs from the date of discovery. Goods that meet the preceding standards are collectively called “conforming Goods.” If conforming Goods are not furnished within the time specified by Capsonic then Capsonic may, at its election and in addition to any other rights or remedies it may have at law or in equity, have the nonconforming Goods repaired, replaced, or corrected at Supplier’s expense. Supplier is responsible for the costs of repairing, replacing or correcting nonconforming Goods, and for all related costs, expenses and damages including, but not limited to, the costs of removal, disassembly, failure analysis, fault isolation, reinstallation, re-inspection, and retrofit of the nonconforming Goods or of Capsonic’s affected end-product; all freight charges; all customer charges; and all corrective action costs (i.e., costs of additional inspection or quality-control systems). Unless set off by Capsonic, Supplier will reimburse Capsonic for all such costs upon receipt of Capsonic’s invoice</p>

If any change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performing this Purchase Order, an equitable adjustment will be made in the Purchase Order price, delivery dates or both, and this Purchase Order will be modified in writing or electronically accordingly. Any claim for adjustment under this provision may, at Capsonic’s option, be deemed to be waived unless asserted in writing (including the amount of the claim) and delivered to Capsonic within 30 days from the date of the receipt by Supplier of the Capsonic-directed change to the Purchase Order. If the cost of property made obsolete or excess as a result of a change is paid by Capsonic, Capsonic may prescribe the manner of disposition of the property.
